/**
 * 69. Sqrt(x)
 * Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer.
 * The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
 * You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
 * For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: x = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: x = 8
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
